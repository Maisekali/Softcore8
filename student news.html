<p class="" data-end="729" data-start="307">Students at Kenyatta University 
demonstrated creativity, leadership, and problem-solving skills at this year’s 
Annual Student Innovation Showcase, held last Friday in the university’s 
Innovation Hall. The event brought together undergraduates and graduate students 
from a wide range of academic disciplines to present their projects, research, 
startups, and social initiatives to faculty, peers, and local community members.</p>

<p class="" data-end="1117" data-start="731">More than 60 projects were 
featured, including sustainable engineering designs, mobile apps for mental 
wellness, creative writing collections, and public health outreach campaigns. 
One of the event highlights was a group of environmental science majors who 
developed a low-cost, solar-powered water filtration system for rural 
communities—earning them the "Innovation for Impact" award.</p>
<p class="" data-end="1380" data-start="1119">“I loved seeing how students from 
different departments collaborated,” said Sarah Malik, a senior majoring in 
Business and Marketing. “It really shows how much talent and energy there is on 
campus—and how we’re encouraged to turn our ideas into something real.”</p>
<p class="" data-end="1748" data-start="1382">The showcase also gave students a 
chance to connect with alumni, industry professionals, and university partners, 
many of whom offered mentorship opportunities, internships, and even seed 
funding for promising projects. For many students, it was a stepping stone into 
launching their first business, publishing academic work, or contributing to 
real-world solutions.</p>

<p class="" data-end="2050" data-start="1750">The event is just one example of 
how Kenyatta University supports student innovation and celebrates student 
success beyond the classroom. With more events, competitions, and creative 
opportunities on the horizon, the future continues to look bright for the 
university’s next generation of changemakers.</p>
